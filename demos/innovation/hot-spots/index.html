<p>Interactive video is a concept used in many applications â€” marketing, eLearning, eCommerce, and digital storytelling, just to name a few. This demo shows a simple yet effective implementation, with hyperlink icons popping in and out over the video. Icons can link to external pages, chapter markers in the current video, or to other videos.</p>

<p>The list of hyperlinks is loaded in the player from a VTT file. Since the link icons are rendered in HTML, they work on desktop browsers, iPads and Androids. The iPhone has no custom controls during video playback, so it is excluded for now.</p>
