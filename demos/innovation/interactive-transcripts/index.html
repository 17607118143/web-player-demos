    Closed captions are great for making video accessible to non-native speakers or when audio is not available. They are supported in all editions of JW Player and loaded using WebVTT files. Beyond captions, WebVTT has many useful applications:<br>
    1. Preview thumbnails are shown on the controlbar to assist seeking in the video.<br>
    2. Chapter markers are displayed both on the controlbar and as a table of contents.<br>
    3. A searchable transcript below the video allows for easy searching of keywords. Click on the transcript text to jump to a specific section in the video.
