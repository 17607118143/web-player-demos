  Use our API to create slow motion video playback without editing the original media. At 20s, the player seeks back to the start of an impressive moment, plays it back at half-speed, and then continues playback at normal speed.

  Toggle playback speed by clicking on the settings gear in the control bar and selecting a new speed under the clock
  icon. Here we set custom speeds, but you can also use default ones.
